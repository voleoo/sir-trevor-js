# What is Sir Trevor?

Sir Trevor provides a means to transform a text input into a rich content editor that's been re-imagined for the web. The content of the editor is stored as markdown inside a JSON object, with the structure and the contents of the post serialized inside of it.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Sir Trevor is with [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower), the front-end package manager from Twitter. If you do use Bower, your `bower.json` file should look something like this:

    {
      "name": "your-project",
      "dependencies": {
        "sir-trevor-js": "0.3.2"
      }
    }

Then run `bower install` on your project to install the necessary dependencies.

Alternatively, grab the following files and include them in your project:

  * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download)
  * [Underscore.js](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js)
  * [Eventable](https://github.com/madebymany/eventable/blob/master/eventable.js)
  * [Sir Trevor JS](https://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/blob/master/sir-trevor.js)

And you'll need the following CSS files too:

  * [Sir Trevor](https://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/blob/master/sir-trevor.css)
  * [Sir Trevor Icons](https://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/blob/master/sir-trevor-icons.css)

## Initialising

A Sir Trevor element must be contained inside a form like follows:

    <form>
      <textarea class="js-st-instance"></textarea>
    </form>

Then to transform this element to a Sir Trevor instance:

    <script>
      new SirTrevor.Editor({ el: $('.js-st-instance') });
    </script>

<a name="1-3"></a>
## The Output

Sir Trevor stores structured JSON that describes your document.

A typical piece of Sir Trevor JSON looks like this:

    {
      "data": [{
        "type": "text",
        "data": {
          "text": "Hello, my name is **Sir Trevor**"
        }
      }]
    }

Each piece of JSON is made up of an object that contains the *type* and *data* for the block.

Generally, when rendering Sir Trevor on the server side you should map the types of the blocks to partials that define the presentation of that block, then all you have to do is loop over the JSON data and render the correct partial. You'll need to remember to transform the markdown to HTML using a library too.

For a server-side example, please see our [Sir Trevor Rails gem](http://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-rails). The ideas within this could easily be extrapolated for other languages.

## Retrieving Editor Instances

You can retrieve `SirTrevor.Editor` instances using the `SirTrevor.getInstance` method.

    SirTrevor.getInstance(); // Gets the first instance
    SirTrevor.getInstance('st-editor-11') // Gets editor by it's identifier
    SirTrevor.getInstance(0) // Gets by it's position
